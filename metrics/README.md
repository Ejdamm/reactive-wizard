#Purpose
Provide a way to measure how much time observables/publishers take to execute.

# Key classes
* `Metrics` - metrics for observables

* `PublisherMetrics` - metrics for Publishers

* `HealthRecorder` - records health status on different objects and if someone is interested in the services health in total one can just inject this 
class to check
